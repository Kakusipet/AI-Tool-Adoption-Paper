# Age-Based Adoption of AI Tools and Applications

This repository contains my research paper on the adoption of AI tools across different age groups. The paper explores how younger and older participants engage with AI applications such as virtual assistants, chatbots, and translation tools.

## Overview
Through a survey of 122 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk, the study identifies key patterns in the usage of AI tools and discusses the implications for future AI development. Key insights include:
- **Younger users** (18-34) prefer virtual assistants and translation tools over chatbots.
- **Older users** (35+) show a greater reliance on chatbots compared to other tools.

The paper also applies the **Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)** to explain behavioral trends and provides theoretical insights on technology adoption across different sectors.
